# Student-Exam-Performance
This project predicts student exam scores using machine learning. It features advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and target encoding. A stacked approach combines Ridge Regression and XGBoost with cross-validation to improve accuracy. Model performance is evaluated using RMSE to ensure reliable and robust predictions.
